# The website that I created for LMH Ball 2019
## Note that this website is now offline, hence I've decided not to hide the secret key in settings.py file

To run this website locally, download the source code using git (or any other method) and install all the python requirements from the `requirement.txt` file on your python virtual enviroment. Once finished with installing the pre-requisite packages from `requirements.txt` run the command `python manage.py runserver`.
