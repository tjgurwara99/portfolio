# Pitch Detector - Guitar Tuning App for WearOS

A few months back I wanted to make an app that works for musicians. I play a few music instruments and so I thought it would be very good to have something powerful(useful) for musicians on their wrists. This was all done before I actually saw the advert of a Smart Watch for musicians - it seems that someone beat me to it haha.

In any case, it was quite good for what it did and I was quite happy with it albeit I didn't really had a smart watch so I made a mobile app instead. I still use that app but can't seem to be able to find its source code. Will upload that as well if I do find it.
