    "Since, we will be testing arbitarily large numbers, using a simple implementation of the algorithm would result in exponential increase in computation if there are more than 10 digits (figure depends on the type of processor the program was compiled in). So, in order to get better performance, I had to resort to using Modular exponentiation, which drastically reduced the time it took to calculate the modulo. I made several protypes of the modular exponentiation and tried measuring the time it took to calculate the modulo.\n",

    "The principle of modular exponentiation are based on converting power into a binary format, which makes it possible for us to calculate faster. For example:\n",
